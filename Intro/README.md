Telomeres are repetitive sequences bound by proteins at the ends of chromosomes. They shorten with each round of replication due to the “end replication problem,” the phenomenon in which Okazaki fragments cannot be placed at the very end of a replicating chromosome. This telomere shortening continues until the reach a critically short length. The shortening of the telomere to this critical point results in it appearing to the cell as a one-sided double strand break. The DNA damage response is then activated, usually resulting in cellular senescence. A subset of cells, however, will circumvent cell death by lengthening their telomeres. This often happens via the reactivation of telomerase. However, telomeres can also be lengthened via a mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) in which a critically short telomere uses the end of another chromosome as a template for synthesis. Cells that are able to bypass cell death are then referred to as “survivors”. Previous work on ALT has been largely qualitative, with a gene being determined to have a role in ALT if its deletion completely eliminated ALT or altered the distribution of survivor types (which are determined by chromosome end structure and are in equal distributions in tlc1Δ). Until recently researchers have not had a method with which to determine the frequency of ALT, preventing detection of ALT supressors (which would increase ALT events), genes that have a role in but are not essential for ALT, or genes that have a role in ALT but do not impact survivor type. In this paper, a method for determining ALT frequency was developed. Yeast that are deficient for telomerase due to a deletion of the RNA component TLC1 are passaged in liquid until they reach senescence. These senescent cells are then plated, and the formation of colonies (survivors) is monitored for 5 days. As TLC1 deletion eliminates telomerase function, any colonies that are able to bypass senescence are presumed to have done so via ALT, and the number of survivors that form can be compared to the number of cells plated to determine ALT frequency. Once overall frequency was determined by deleting a component of telomerase known as TLC1, genes suspected of being involved in ALT were deleted and changes in ALT frequency determined. This method is valuable as researchers are now able to quantify the effect of a genes that suppress or are involed in, but not essential for, ALT.

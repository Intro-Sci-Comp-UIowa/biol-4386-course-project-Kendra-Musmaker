Figure 2: Frequency of ALT determined by plating senescent cells. Frequency determined as survivors divided by cells plated. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval calculated as as 𝑓±1.96√((𝑓(1−𝑓)𝑛)), with f = total_frequency and n=total cells. Non-overlapping CI’s considered significantly different frequencies. Values on the y-axis are x10^6.

Frequency for tlc1Δ was found to be 4.4x10^-5 (95% CI 4.2-4.6). This frequency is significantly lower than either mismatch repair gene (MSH2: 1.68x10^-4, CI 1.56-1.81x10^-4; MLH1: 7.4x10^-5, 6.6-8.2x10^-5) or the frequency of the MPH1 deletion (7.9x10^-5, 6.5x10^-5-9.3x10^-5). The MSH2 deletion has the greatest increase in frequency compared to tlc1Δ, with the frequency of the TLC1 deletion being greater than than either of the other mutants, including the mismatch repair gene MLH1.

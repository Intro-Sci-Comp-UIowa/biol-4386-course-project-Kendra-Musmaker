All genes in this study are observed to cause an increase in survivor formation when deleted. This suggests that all of these genes suppress the formation of survivors when present in the cell. That MPH1 causes an increase in frequency when deleted is unsurprising, as MPH1 is a helicase that is known to disrupt d-loops in break-induced replication (BIR). ALT is thought to occur by a break-induced replication like process in which a short telomeric end invades into another telomere, creating a displacement loop (d-loop). As this d-loop is needed for invasion and subsequent beginning of synthesis, if d-loops are prematurely disrupted by MPH1 in ALT, it follows that there would be less formation of survivors with MPH1 present.
The increase in frequency when MSH2 is deleted is consistent with the occurrence of heteroduplex rejection occurring at early stages of ALT. Heteroduplex rejection occurs when a mismatch is detected between two DNA strands by the mismatch repair machinery and is unwound rather than repaired. It is thought that mismatches may frequently occur in early stages of survivor formation in yeast, as in S. cerevisiae the telomeres consist of degenerate TG1-3 repeats. When these mismatches are identified by MSH2 in complex with either MSH3 or MSH6, this may lead downstream to the unwinding of this ALT precursor. With MSH2 deleted, these precursor at regions of imperfect homology may go undetected and unrepaired and proceed to form ALT survivors.
That MLH1 deletion increases ALT frequency is somewhat more surprising. MLH1 acts downstream of ALT in classical repair as an endonuclease that cleaves DNA, which is not a stage in heteroduplex rejection. There has been uncertainty regarding whether or not MLH1 plays a role in heteroduplex rejection. The findings here, however, suggest that MLH1 may be involved in heteroduplex rejection to inhibit the formation of ALT precursors.
Overlaying the data points on the graph reveals variation in individual frequencies. This is not unexpected, as ALT is a stochastic process. It may, however, be important to look into some points with very high ALT frequencies to determine that the survivors form those cultures are likely to have formed independently and not to be derivatives of 1 cell that formed a survivor early in liquid.

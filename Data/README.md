'data_for-comp_sci.csv' and 'data_for_comp_sci_edited.csv' contain the same columns, but all the columns survivors and cells_plated are treated as numbers in the edited version,
 versus characters in the unedited version.
Each row is an individual culture. Strain is the strain from which that culture was derived. Genotype is the genotype of that culture. Survivors is the survivors formed on plates from that 
colony and cells_plated`is the number of cells plated for that colony with extra doublings taken into account.The strains are 6169 (TLC1/tlc1::BSD, MSH2/msh2::kan),
6212(TLC1/tlc1::BSD, MPH1/mph1::kan) and 6205(TLC1/tlc1::BSD, MLH1/mlh1::kan). Experiments were run between 2020 and early 2023.
